= The Code Runner

[.lead]
_The Code Runner_ repository is a personal project part of my journey as a
Web Developer. The main goal is to practice my learnings, develop better
coding habits, and improve my skills.

It will help me to keep a record of my improvement, and to keep notes and
thoughts related to my coding career.

You are welcome to make comments, raise issues, and be supportive. I will
appreciate every bit of knowledge and resources. Share links to
tutorials, articles or books, mentors, boot-camps, or whatever you think
it may be of any help.
