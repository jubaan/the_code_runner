== PROBLEM

This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the
results. Let's have a look at some examples:

  seven(times(five)) # must return 35
  four(plus(nine)) # must return 13
  eight(minus(three)) # must return 5
  six(divided_by(two)) # must return 3

=== Requirements:

* There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations:
plus, minus, times, dividedBy (`divided_by` in Ruby and Python)
* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner
function represents the right operand
* Divison should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not
`2.666666...`:

  eight(divided_by(three))
