== PROBLEM

Dan is playing a video game in which his character competes in a hurdle
race. Hurdles are of varying heights, and Dan has a maximum height he can
jump. There is a magic potion he can take that will increase his maximum
height by 1 unit for each dose. How many doses of the potion must he take to
be able to jump all of the hurdles.

Given an array of hurdle heights _height_, and an initial maximum height Dan can
jump, _k_, determine the minimum number of doses Dan must take to be able to
clear all the hurdles in the race.

For example, if _height_ = [1,2,3,3,2] and Dan can jump 1 unit high
naturally, he must take 3 - 1 = 2 doses of potion to be able to jump all of
the hurdles.

=== Function Description

Complete the hurdleRace function in the editor below. It should return the
minimum units of potion Dan needs to drink to jump all of the hurdles.

hurdleRace has the following parameter(s):

* _k_: an integer denoting the height Dan can jump naturally
* _height_: an array of integers denoting the heights of each hurdle

=== Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers _n_ and _k_, the number of
hurdles and the maximum height Dan can jump naturally.
The second line contains _n_ space-separated integers _height_[_i_]
where 0 &lt;= _i_ &lt; _n_.

=== Constraints

* 1 &lt;= _n_, _k_ &lt;= 100
* 1 &lt;= _height_[_i_] &lt;= 100

=== Output Format

Print an integer denoting the minimum doses of magic potion Dan must drink
to complete the hurdle race.

=== Sample Input 0

  5 4
  1 6 3 5 2

=== Sample Output 0

  2

=== Explanation 0

Dan's character can jump a maximum of _k_ = 4 units, but the tallest hurdle has a
height of _h_~1~ = 6:

To be able to jump all the hurdles, Dan must drink 6 - 4 = 2 doses.

=== Sample Input 1

  5 7
  2 5 4 5 2

=== Sample Output 1

  0

=== Explanation 1

Dan's character can jump a maximum of _k_ = 7 units, which is enough to cross all
the hurdles:

Because he can already jump all the hurdles, Dan needs to drink 0 doses.
