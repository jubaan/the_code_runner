== PROBLEM

Given two integers `a` and `b`, which can be positive or negative, find the sum
of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two
numbers are equal return `a` or `b`.

Note: `a` and `b` are not ordered!

=== Examples

  get_sum(1, 0) == 1   # 1 + 0 = 1
  get_sum(1, 2) == 3   # 1 + 2 = 3
  get_sum(0, 1) == 1   # 0 + 1 = 1
  get_sum(1, 1) == 1   # 1 Since both are same
  get_sum(-1, 0) == -1 # -1 + 0 = -1
  get_sum(-1, 2) == 2  # -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
