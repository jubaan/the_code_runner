# The Code Runner

![eat-code-repeat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25774518/90563889-10088c00-e16a-11ea-8124-ecb5fd313b2a.gif)

_The Code Runner_ repository is a personal project part of my journey as a
Web Developer. The main goal is to practice my learnings, develop better
coding habits, and improve my skills.

It will help me to keep a record of my improvement, and be useful for notetaking.

You are welcome to make comments, raise issues, and be supportive. I will
appreciate every bit of knowledge and resources. Share links to
tutorials, articles or books, mentors, boot-camps, or whatever you think
it may be of any help.

## Quick notes

### Ruby

- Redability first, later optimization and refactor.
